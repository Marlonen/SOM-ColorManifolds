SOM for Color Manifolds (Python)
====

Simple python demos of Data-driven Color Manifolds [Nguyen et al. 2015].

They used self-organizing maps (**SOM**) to construct data-driven **color manifolds**.

## Result
*Status*: Under construction.

## Installation

*Note*: This program was only tested on **Windows** with **Python2.7**.
**Linux** and **Mac OS** are not officially supported,
but the following instructions might be helpful for installing on those environments.

### Dependencies
Please install the following required python modules.

* **NumPy**
* **SciPy**
* **matplotlib**
* **OpenCV**

As these modules are heavily dependent on NumPy modules, please install appropriate packages for your development environment (Python versions, 32-bit or 64bit).
For 64-bit Windows, you can download the binaries from [**Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages**](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).

This program also uses **docopt** for CLI.
**docopt** will be installed automatically through the following **pip** command for main modules.

### Install main modules
*Status*: Under construction.

<!-- You can use **pip** command for installing main modules.
Please run the following command from the shell.

``` bash
  > pip install git+https://github.com/tody411/SOM-ColorManifolds.git
``` -->

## Usage
*Status*: Under construction.

<!-- ## API Document

API document will be managed by [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) framework.
Online version is provided in the following link:
